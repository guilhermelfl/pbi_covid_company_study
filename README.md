# pbi_covid_company_study

This project was based on tests a Group of companies paid for the employees to test for COVID-19, This way they can find which employee already have COVID and is imune with the IgG positive. Meaning they are safe to go back to work from the local site.

Since the data in this project is confidential, I'll be only sharing the images of the modified Power BI without any client/confidential information.

Hope you guys like it.
